0. PNG = ~ 16 million Colors 
   GIF = ~ 265 colors
   BMP = ~ 16 million colors 
   JPEG = ~ 16 million colors 
1.  GIF formatted files support animation. 
2.  Lossless compression reduces the files size without sacrificing image quality. These files are not capable of being compressed to the degree of lossy compression. 
    Lossy compression removes a chunk of information that may not be visible to the user such that size is prioritized over quality. 
3.  JPEG is Lossy Compressed. 
4.  You simply remove the pointer to that specific address in memory. However the data itself is still present. The metadata that composes the pointer is rewritten.  
    subsequently, the cluster of the file in FAT, is moved to a list of free clusters.  
5.  You can physically destroy the Hard Drive, degausse the magnetic drives, or simply overwrite all of the drives data into NULL characters so that the original data can't be recovered. 
6.  stdint.h is a prewritten header file that contains the amount of bits requried 
    in order to store integers. 
7.  These values establish the amount of bits that an uninitialized integer takes. 
8.  They are 1, 4, 4, and 2 bits respectively. This only applies to 32 bit machines. 
9.  The first byte is a B and the second byte is a M. Written in ASCII, 66 and 77 
    respectively. 
10. bfsize is a measure of the size in bytes of the BMP file and biSize is a measure of the number of bytes necessary for the structure. 
11. The bitmap is top-down device-independent bitmap (DIB) and begins in the top left corner. 
12. biBitCount
13. This may demonstrate that the file is not in that location or simply does not 
    exist. 
14. This establishes the number of elements that need to be read. 
15. It assigns a value of 0. 
16. It places the pointer in a unique, new position. 
17. Shows the current position of the file pointer.
